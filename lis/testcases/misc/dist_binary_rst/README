Distributed Binary Restart Testcase

This test demonstrates writing distributed binary for both LIS_RST and LIS_DAPERT files with a assimilation example over the Tuolumne watershed.

This is a testcase that uses:
  (a) The MERRA2 forcing
  (b) Bilinear Interpolation
  (c) The NoahMP 4.0.1 land surface model
  (d) Tuolumne watershed
  (e) A time period from 0z 29 Oct 2015 to 0z 3 Nov 2015

This directory contains:
  (a) This README file
  (b) The "lis.config" file used for this testcase
  (c) The "MODEL_OUTPUT_LIST.TBL" file used by the lis.config file
      to select the output variables
  (d) An "output.ctl" file used to display the output in GrADS from
      the LIS run

Note that the "lis.config" file should be edited
to make sure that the locations of the parameter and forcing files
are specified correctly.

To run this testcase:
  (a) Generate the LIS executable
  (b) Run the LIS executable using the "lis.config" file with the
      testcase input data
  (c) View the binary output using the testcase GrADS files

Caveats:
  (a) Please note that this is a simple functional test and the output
      from the testcase is not expected to be used for any scientific
      evaluation.
